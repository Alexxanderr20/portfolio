           Hello! My name is Edward and I love creating things that involve <br>
           coding and the internet. I learned about the idea of coding and web <br>
           development through freeCodeCamp, more sepcifically the front-end development <br>
           section, and I've been obssessed ever since! <br><br><br>

           Fast forward three years later, and I've managed to build the website, <br> 
           that you're currently visting as well as a couple of other interesting side projects <br>
           involving not only HTML and CSS, but also JavaScript. <br><br><br>

           I'm currently a junior studying software engineering in university as well, <br>
           and I hope to put those skills to use whether it be a client, a start-up, or an established company.
